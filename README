CPANPLUS-Dist-SUSE

This is a simple module which inherits from CPANPLUS::Dist::RPM that
allows for creating RPM packages under SUSE. In particular, this
RPM spec file has been tested in SLES 11.

It also honors Module::Build if Build.PL is in the distribution.

Simple way of creating and installing a module is:

 cpan2dist --verbose --format CPANPLUS::Dist::SUSE --buildprereq --dist-opts="--replacefiles=" --install Module::Builder

"--replacefiles=" can be used when you want to install with rpm option 
"--replacefiles"
